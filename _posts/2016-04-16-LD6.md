Okay, time for the first code rework.

I was the-stupid and defined a scaling routine for a non-growing level of
detail, which, since we're starting from 1-pixel will clearly NOT WORK.


Instead, every time we reach a nxn pixel threshold (square), we need to
re-render with a new level of detail.  I'll probably just pre-calc these.

Asside from that periodic blit, the algorithm will work the same.

Back to it.
