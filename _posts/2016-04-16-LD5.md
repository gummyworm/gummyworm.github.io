Let's talk memory map.

The bitmap will take 2040 bytes. Ouch.  Another 150 bytes are needed for the
screen, so that's a whopping sum of 2190 ($88e) bytes.

The char-data is dang close to $800 bytes, which is nice.  Might as well put
that at $1800.  Effective

The screen data is a little awkwardly sized.  Let's just put it at $1700.
Whatever.

Can't do much about that, boys!


It's pretty obvious that we're going to have to be pretty frugal with everything
else.  The map is probably going to have to be at least mostly generated.

The sprite routines are probably going to take a really good chunk of space.
We'll see what's left after those are in.


| Address Range | Use   |
| --------------------- |
| $1000-$1700   | logic |
| $1700-$1796   | screen|
| $1796-$1800   | data  |
| $1800-$18f8   | bitmap|
| $18f8-$18ff   | data  |

The cassette buffer, color RAM, zeropage, and most of the stack will probably
get used one way or another.  Stay tuned..
