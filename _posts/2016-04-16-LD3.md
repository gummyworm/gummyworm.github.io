Gooooood morning everybody.

It's just before 7.  First time this week waking up after sunrise and it feels
pretty good.

I thought of a few concepts last night while I was laying awake, so it's time
to get moving on this game.  

I'm going to be using a scrolling raster routine from a Christmas demo I made
last year because I've been wanting an excuse to make it more flexible.
In particular, I need a little finer control over the rate and size of the
rasters.  Since the perspective that the effect is supposed to emulate kind of
necessitates some sort of scaling for the graphics, I'll be needing to do that
somehow.  I'm definitely leaning toward a "more small objects" approach rather
than a "one/few large object(s)" one.

Yeeears ago I prototyped a Zelda-esque game for the unexpanded Vic.  I'm strongly
considering revisiting that after picking up all those fantasy vibes from the
Wikipedia article.  Obviously the scope is gonna have to be seriously limited.

The scaling has a lot of immediately obvious challenges I'm going to have to
work around too.

Alright, gonna go do a set at the gym so I can pretend that I still lift.
