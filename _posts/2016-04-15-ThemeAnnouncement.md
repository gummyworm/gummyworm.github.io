Time for a stream of consciousness post.  Because, boys and girls, it's
brainstorming time.

Shapeshift.

This might actually be the first time I'm happy with the theme, so that's cool.

I can already see all the procedural low-poly Unity crap that the theme is gonna
spawn...it is what it is.

Anyway, shapeshifting is a tricky one for such a memory constrained machine.
I was pretty sure going into this I was gonna be doing the ususal soft sprite
B.S., but this theme is making me consider a more dynamic approach to the
graphics.

It's tempting to use a 128x128 bitmap (always fun), but I'm not positive yet.

I'm also kind of obsessed with breakfast, so I might shoehorn that concept into
the design somehow.

I'm going to shower and ponder ideas more. brb

...

The shower, sadly, did not yield the inspiration I hoped it would.  But 
reading the wikipedia article for shapeshifting is inspiring, but most of that
inspiration is of very epic in nature.  Not a good idea for a Ludum Dare.

Well, as previously mentioned it was a rough last couple of nights.  Morning
comes quickly.  The coding begins at dawn.
