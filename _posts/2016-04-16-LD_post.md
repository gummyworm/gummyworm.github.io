So whoooo saw that coming?

I did.

Between a brutally sleep deprived start and end to the weekend and an
outrageously gorgeous couple of days, I (obviously) did not complete my plans
for the 35th Ludum Dare.  While it was fun to pretend this outcome was not
predicted, I am very unsurprised.  Even under perfect circumstances I had a bit
too much ambition.

However, as I mentioned in my first post- I really wanted to start putting
something together with some code I've been sitting on a while.  Towards that
goal I succeeded.  Even more importantly, I had a lot of fun doing some good old
assembly on my favorite humble machine.  I've been in a bit of a coding slump
as of late, so hopefully I can use the motivation I felt Saturday to start
gaining some real momentum.
