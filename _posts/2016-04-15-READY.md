Wellll.  Two and half hours until Ludum Dare 35 begins.  I've hardly slept the 
last two nights, so I'm afraid it's going to be a rough start.

Because I'm a man my tools will be ca65, vim, and vice.  We're going old-school
for this one boys.  The target platform will be the Vic-20 because it's the best
of all computers, and the target memory configuration will be unexpanded because
f*@$ cops.

At 5.5K of RAM that means we're looking at ```5.5*1024/(48*60)=~1.8```
bytes/minute.

I'll probably spend the first, eh, 30 minutes designing before I start laying
dem bytes.  We'll see.

Alrighty, no more time to chat for now.  I'm off to get Chipotle and provisions.
