Sup, fools.

It's 7:22 P.M.

I have returned from my Chipotle/snack run and am sufficiently satiated for the
challenge ahead.  While all you tryhards are scrambling to configure all fifty
of your stupid libraries and dragging packages of awful Unity assets into your
ugly project directory, I am just chilling waiting for the theme announcement.
As I said, my toolchain is literally nothing.

I guess I could be digging up some
old routines, but, meh.  I might use the ol' stable raster interrupt trick from
C= Hacking.  Otherwise, whatev's.

Alrighty...35 minutes to go. Got a diet pepsi in the freezer DO NOT LET ME
FORGET THAT.

Bring it.
