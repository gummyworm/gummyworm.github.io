After (little) consideration, I've reworked the scaling to a purely pre-calced
approach.  I decided at the sizes I'm dealing with, it's just worth it.  And,
realistically, if I have any chance at half decent speed, I'm going to need to
do pre-calc wherever at all possible.

So the scaling has been simplified drastically and is done for now.  I will
probably revisit it soon to optimize.

That's all for now.  I'll check in tomorrow with the plans for the weekend. B)
